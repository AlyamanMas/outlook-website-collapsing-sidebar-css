This is custom CSS for outlook.office.com that allows the sidebar to collapse by default and expand when hovered over in order to save screen space.

In order to use, you need to use a browser extension like Stylus to be able to apply custom CSS to certain websites. If you use Stylus, this CSS should be already published there so you can install it directly from the extension.
